# IoTs Aquarium project of Logic Design Project lecture (CO2021)

In this logic design project, we want to introduce an Aquarium system based on the basis of the
Internet of Things technology. IoT means the connection of any devices (including everything from
cell phones, vehicles, home appliances and other wearable embedded with sensors and actuators) with
the Internet so that these objects can exchange data with each other on a network. In 4.0 industrial
era, home appliances which bring out the convenience to the user are in high demand. The Aquarium
system uses Node MCU ESP8266 platform - a low power, low cost, and open source IoT platform.
This smart aquarium allows the user to observe temperature, replace the water in a tank and also feed
fishes with the schedule which is set up by user via Internet-based communication protocol(MQTT).
